	tied:
	pierce: armor break (increases damage taken by physical attacks, low but stacks)
	slash: bleed (Low damage DOT that stacks)
	bludgeon: daze/stun (strong enemies have speed reduced to lowest multiple of 50, weak enemies lose a turn)
	fire: burn (High DOT, increases target speed by 50, which grants an extra action per turn, but also triggers the DOT more often)
	cold: freeze 
	lightning: electrified (the target has an electric aura which will hurt enemies that target them but lowers their resistance to lightning damage further, so bit of a mixed blessing)
	wind: blown away (chance to insta-kill weaker enemies or temporarily remove stronger ones/party members)
	acid/poison: poisoned
	light: blinded
	dark: cursed
	arcane: discombobulated
