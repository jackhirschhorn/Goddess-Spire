	4 stances for ki blade
	rage
	tied:
	pierce: armor break (increases damage taken by physical attacks, low but stacks)
	slash: bleed (Low damage DOT that stacks)
	bludgeon: daze/stun (strong enemies have speed reduced to lowest multiple of 50, weak enemies lose a turn)
	fire: burn (High DOT, increases target speed by 50, which grants an extra action per turn, but also triggers the DOT more often. cancels freeze)
	cold: freeze (frozen solid and stunned for a long duration, until hit. resistant to all damage in this state. cancels burn.)
	lightning: electrified (the target has an electric aura which will hurt enemies that target them but lowers their resistance to lightning damage further, so bit of a mixed blessing)
	wind: blown away (chance to insta-kill weaker enemies or temporarily remove stronger ones/party members)
	acid/poison: poisoned (low DOT, causes stacking ATK and SPD penalty to target that is removed with poison. refreshing duration is key)
	light: blinded (50% for attacks to miss)
	dark: cursed (target takes dark damage equal to the damage they cause)
	arcane: discombobulated (no control over targets, may target allies), sleep (target skips their turn, can be woken up by a tactic or damage)
